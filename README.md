# Scaffold
World management plugin for build servers.

This project is a fork of Avicus Network's [Build Plugin](https://github.com/Avicus/Scaffold). Kudos to them for their great work.

## Server Setup

1. Start with the latest stable [Paper (PaperSpigot)](https://papermc.io/ci/job/Paper/) build.

2. Compile the latest version of Scaffold or download it from our [Jenkins](https://jenkins.bennydoesstuff.me/job/Scaffold/).

3. Start the server. The 3 most basic commands in the plugin are ``/create``, ``/worlds``, and ``/open``.
